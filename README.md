# Improved Neon Rims Controls
This is a small CET script I made primarily for a friend to take screenshots with the neon rims being on while not sitting on the bike.


## Features
- Setting to turn on neon rims when mounting a bike **(Default: On)**
- Setting to turn on neon rims when dismounting a bike **(Default: On)**
- Toggle to turn neon rims on and off while not on a bike **(Hotkey 0)**
- Setting to only control actual neon rims. By default, all vehicle lights considered utility are affected **(Default: Off)**
- Setting for the toggle hotkey to only control actual neon rims **(Default: Off)**
- Setting to turn headlights on when dismounting a bike/vehicle **(Default: Off)**
- Setting for the toggle hotkey to toggle neon rims and headlights at the same time **(Default: Off)**

**If you have both settings turned on, the neon rims should be always on.**

To change settings, open the menu and go to `Mods -> Improved Neon Rims Controls`

## Usage
Police car siren lights and all other lights considered as "utility" light by the game are also controlled with this script.
The toggle only works if you're not on the bike/vehicle.
If you summon a bike/vehicle, you must mount and dismount the bike/vehicle at least once for it to work. This also applies to all vehicles found in the world.
While on the bike, you can turn neon rims on and off with the default `E key` (this is a vanilla Cyberpunk 2077 feature)

**If you have the "only control actual neon rims" setting(s) activated, but the neon rims on your bike do not turn on, please tell me
which bike you are using, so I can add it to the list of bikes.**
