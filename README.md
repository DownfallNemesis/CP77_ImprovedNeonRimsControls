# Toggle Neon Rims While Off The Bike
This is a small CET script I made primarily for a friend to take screenshots with the neon rims being on while not sitting on the bike.

### Usage
To toggle the neon rims on and off, press the 0 key. It only works if you're not on the bike.
If you summon a bike, you must get on and off the bike at least once for it to work.
While on the bike, you can turn them on and off with the default E key (this is a vanilla Cyberpunk 2077 feature)

### Requierments
Cyber Engine Tweaks ([NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107)/[GitHub](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/releases))
### Installation
Download the .zip and unpack the contents into your Cyberpunk 2077 root directory.
