# Toggle Neon Rims While Off The Bike
This is a small CET script I made primarily for a friend to take screenshots with the neon rims being on while not sitting on the bike.


## Usage
To toggle the neon rims on and off, press the `0 key`. It only works if you're not on the bike.
If you summon a bike, you must get on and off the bike at least once for it to work.
While on the bike, you can turn them on and off with the default `E key` (this is a vanilla Cyberpunk 2077 feature)


## Requierments
Legal copy of Cyberpunk 2077
Cyber Engine Tweaks ([NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107)/[GitHub](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/releases))


## Installation
Unpack the `.zip` file and drop the `bin` folder in your Cyberpunk 2077 root directory.
